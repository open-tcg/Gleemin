% NOTES:
/*
	readlist - read a list of words, adapted from a Clocksin & Mellish
	  by Amzi.com, in : http://www.amzi.com/AdventureInProlog/appendix.php
	
	Rule no. 1: remember that not every Magic ability is recognised by 
	  the interpreter yet. 
	When calling read_MGL remember to input activated abilities' costs as 
	  _not_ separated by commas and always followed by a colon. 
	When you enter single quotes, disregard the limitations of Edinburgh 
	  syntax- just go ahead and enter the word the way you would normally.
	  For example, don't write: 'owner''s'. Do write: owner's.
	Names of cards with one or more spaces in them should be concatenated
	  using the "&" symbol, for example: Goblin&Balloon&Brigade.
	Enter each element of a +X/+X etc counters or gets ability separated by
	  spaces : "+ 1 / + 1" , not "+1/+1". The interpreter splits up each 
	  modifier in its components in order to verify that it's indeed a 
	  modifier. The result is rather clunky input- I'll have to fix that. 
	  Eventually. 
	When entering triggered abilities, separate the condition from the effect
	  with a comma, for example: 
		When Aether&Adept enters the Battlefield, 
			return target Creature to its owner's hand.
	  This will produce a rather ugly output, like: 
		[When,Aether Adept,enters,the,Battlefield,(,),return,
			target,Creature,to,its,owner's,hand]
	  And by "ugly" I do mean that weird "(,)" thing (no, it's not a smilie
	  of a merry elephant walking away).
	  I'm working on it.
