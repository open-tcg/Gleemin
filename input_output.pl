% Doing:
%	Done fixing inspect ouptut for abilities on the Stack
%	Noticed the inspect output takes in lowercase zone names as arguments!
%	adding activate_abilities.
% 	updating deal_damage outputs (to new inputs)
%	add [h]elp options to player actions sub-menus!
%
% Todo
%	add all the wrong_input clauses from combat output on!
%	add break option to player actions menu (needs player_actions change)?
%
% NOTES:
%	Fix the mise options in declare_blockers outputs (cancel and ok not
