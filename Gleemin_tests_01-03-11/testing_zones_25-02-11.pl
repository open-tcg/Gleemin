%	The controller of a permanent is the player under whose control
%  	  it entered the Battlefield. In the MVM controllership is
%	  derived by the presence of a card on a Battlefield partition.
%	  Local echantments should stay on their controller's Battlefield
% 	  partition; their effect should be included in the state of their
%	  targets (and their own). For example, enchants(Permanent) and
%	  enchanted_by(Permanent), where Permanent is always a copy/3 entry.
%	Similar considerations apply to copies of spells targeting other
%	  spells on the stack. 
%	When control of a permanent changes, the predicate responsible must
%	  add the information that changed_controller(Owner, Controller) to
% 	  its state, unless Owner = Controller (whereupon, the Owner has 
%	  resumed control of the Permanent)
