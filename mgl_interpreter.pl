% Doing:
%	noticed that burn effect sends only name of source
%	(also needs Id). The reason is I'm not actually associating
%	the source of an effect with the effect (this/1 does recognise
%	a permanent with an ability that refers to itself, so use it)
% Todo
%	Fix targeting (uncontrolled backtracking)
%	  and update to current version again.
%
% NOTES:
%	Handles both abilities and effects.

	% ^ Merh. This found that Cost = [tap, u] (on backtracking
	% after finding Cost = tap). Maybe I should define cost more
	%  rigorously, as what comes after a colon...

	% Yep, see? These two determine a mana cost differently; one is a
	%  mana string: 2341ubgrw, the other is a list of mana symbols:
	%  2341u,b,g,r,w. That's because I have a new definition in here
	% I should  bring it in line with the older one, I think it's more
